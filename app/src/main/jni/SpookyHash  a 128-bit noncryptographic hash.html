<center><h3>SpookyHash: a 128-bit noncryptographic hash</h3></center>

<p>SpookyHash is a public domain noncryptographic hash function producing
well-distributed 128-bit hash values for byte arrays of any length.
It can produce 64-bit and 32-bit hash values too, at the same speed, just
use the bottom n bits.  The C++ reference implementation is specific
to 64-bit x86 platforms, in particular it assumes the processor is
little endian.  Long keys hash in 3 bytes per cycle, short keys take
about 1 byte per cycle, and there is a 30 cycle startup cost.  Keys
can be supplied in fragments. The function allows a 128-bit seed.
It's named SpookyHash because it was released on Halloween.</p>

<p>C++ code for SpookyHash:
  </p><ul>
    <li><a href="http://burtleburtle.net/bob/c/spooky.h">spooky.h</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://burtleburtle.net/bob/c/spooky.cpp">spooky.cpp</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://burtleburtle.net/bob/c/testspooky.cpp">testspooky.cpp</a></li>
  </ul>

<p>Why use SpookyHash?
 </p><ul>
  <li>It's fast.  For short keys it's 1 byte per cycle, with a 30 cycle
  startup cost.  For long keys, well, it would be 3 bytes per cycle,
  and that only occupies one core.  Except you'll hit the limit of
  how fast uncached memory can be read, which on my home machines is
  less than 2 bytes per cycle.</li>

  <li>It's good.  It achieves avalanche for 1-bit and 2-bit
  inputs.  It works for any type of key that can be made to look like
  an array of bytes, or list of arrays of bytes.  It takes a seed, so
  it can produce many different independent hashes for the same key.</li>

  <li>It can produce up to 128-bit results.  Large systems should
  consider using 128-bit checksums nowadays.  A library with 4 billion
  documents is expected to have about 1 colliding 64-bit checksum no
  matter how good the hash is.  Libraries using 128-bit checksums
  should expect 1 collision once they hit 16 quintillion documents.
  (Due to limited hardware, I can only verify SpookyHash is as good as
  a good 73-bit checksum.  It might be better, I can't tell.)</li>

  <li>When NOT to use it: if you have an opponent.  This
  is not cryptographic.  Given a message, a resourceful opponent could
  write a tool that would produce a modified message with the same hash
  as the original message.  Once such a tool is written, a
  not-so-resourceful opponent could borrow the tool and do the same
  thing.</li>

  <li>Another case not to use it: CRCs have a nice property that you
  can split a message up into pieces arbitrarily, calculate the CRC
  all the pieces, then aftewards combine the CRCs for the pieces to
  find the CRC for the concatenation of all those pieces.  SpookyHash
  can't.  If you could deterministically choose what the pieces were,
  though, you could compute the hashes for pieces with SpookyHash (or
  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/cityhash/">CityHash</a> or any
  other hash), then treat those hash values as the raw data, and do
  CRCs on top of that.</li>

  <li>Big-endian machines aren't supported by the current
  implementation.  The hash would run, and it would produce equally
  good results, but they'd be different results from little-endian
  platforms.  Machines that can't handle unaligned reads also
  won't work by default, but there's a macro in the implementation to
  tweak that will let it deal with unaligned reads.  x86-compatible
  machines are little-endian and support unaligned reads.</li>

 </ul>
<p></p>

<p>For long keys, the inner loop of SpookyHash is Spooky::Mix().  It
consumes an 8-byte input, then does an xor, another xor, a rotation,
and an addition.  The internal state won't entirely fit in registers
  after 3 or 4 8-byte variables.  But parallelism keeps increasing,
  and so does avalanche per pass.  There was a sweet spot around 12
  variables.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://burtleburtle.net/bob/c/lookup2.c">previous</a> <a href="http://burtleburtle.net/bob/c/lookup3.c">hashes</a> would have added 12 8-byte inputs
to the 12 variables, then done a few passes through all the variables
to mix them well, then added the next batch of inputs.  That is
tested by <a href="http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/avalanche.html">avalanche.html</a>.  Unlike my previous
hashes, Spooky::Mix() is trickle-feed.  It adds an input to one
variable, does a little mixing, then adds data to the next variable.
There is no bulk mixing stage in between groups of 12 variables; the
processing treats all variables symmetrically.  Trickle-feeding should
allow chips to keep a static workload, doing a steady
proportion of memory fetches, additions, XORs, and rotates
simultaneously.</p>

<p>Testing a trickle-feed mix was a new problem.  As always, it has to
work equally well when run forward or backwards.  As always, every
input bit has to produce 128 bits of apparent entropy before all those
bits could be canceled by other input bits.  (128 bits, because the
hash produces a 128-bit result.)  My handwave is that after 12 8-byte
inputs, there has been as much input as there is internal state, so
anything could be overwritten.  So if a delta appears to produce 128
bits of entropy by 12 8-byte inputs after the delta starts, that's
good enough.  I wrote <a href="http://burtleburtle.net/bob/c/screen.cpp">screen.cpp</a> to
check for that.</p>

<p>I tried SSE2 instructions, and 64-bit multiplications, but it
turned out that plain 64-bit rotate, addition, and XOR got results
faster than those.  I thought 4 or 6 variable schemes were
going to win, but 12 variables won in the end.  My boss suggests I
look into GPUs.  I haven't tried that yet.  But given that the memory
bandwidth is maxed out, I doubt they would help.</p>

<p>While Spooky::Mix() handles the middle of long keys well, it would
need 4 repetitions for the final mix, and it has a huge startup cost.
That would make short keys expensive.  So I found the ShortHash to
produce a 128-bit hash of short keys with little startup cost, and
Spooky::End() to reduce the final mixing cost (this shows up most for
keys just over 192 bytes long).  Those components aren't trickle-feed,
they work the old way.  ShortHash is used automatically for short keys.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://burtleburtle.net/bob/c/froggy.cpp">frog test</a> is the most stringent
test I have for 64-bit and 128-bit noncryptogrpahic hashes.  It hashes
n-byte keys that are all zero except for m bits set, for all possible
choices of m bits, and looks for collisions.  Once it maxes out memory
it keeps as many hashes as it can and continues churning through keys.
Ideally you'd test a 128-bit hash by checking 2<sup>128</sup> key-pairs, which
should produce about 1 collision if the function is adequately random.
That's way beyond my means.  2<sup>72</sup> key-pairs is about the
limit of my testing abilities.</p>

<p>I have not tried the CRC32 instruction that started in the Nehalem
Intel chips, because I don't have one.  Google has,
with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/cityhash/">CityHash</a>.  They
claim 6 bytes per cycle, which is faster than any hash I've seen.  On
my machine CityHash about half the speed of SpookyHash; mine doesn't
have a CRC32 instruction.  CityHash passes my frog test for at least 
2<sup>72</sup> keypairs.</p> 

<p>The number of key-pairs covered scales linearly with the
speed and number of CPUs and time dedicated to the task, and
quadratically with the memory and disk that can be thrown at it.  My
current implementation of the frog test can use all a machine's cores, but
it only uses RAM to hold the keys.  I'm working on another version
(named the hog test) that would use all the disk, RAM, and CPU you could
throw at it.  If you could produce 16 petabytes
of 16-byte hashes, and sort them, and detect collisions, that would
cover 2<sup>100</sup> key-pairs.  Sorting 16 terabytes of hashes would
cover 2<sup>80</sup> key-pairs.  This would look remarkably like the
terasort benchmark, except it would be actually accomplishing
something useful.</p>

<!--
February 2, 2012.  Production, same bits as Beta.
December 31, 2011.  Beta.  Long mix seems OK, was tested for 2-bit deltas.
October 31, 2011.  Alpha again.  ShortHash enabled, long mix is flawed.
October 31, 2010.  Alpha.  ShortHash disabled.  Use 3 mixes for final.
